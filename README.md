# Fingerprint Recognition
The inspiration for this project is from a tv show called "Dexter". Dexter is a forensic expert in a blood spatter analyst, most of the time fingerprint matching is a Masuka's job, but some time Dexter have to deal with the finger print too. <br><br>

# Overview
In this project am gonna try to make a fingerprint matching pattern between two image to see how the match of these fingerprint like a miami police department fingerprint matching system, this may include some of a image processing knowledge about feature mathcing.
There are plenty of a technique that i could think of for example ORB, SIFT, FLANN. Or even using CNN but i dont wanna go that deep into machine learning. So in this repo am gonna try to find the best method that suit this project. <br><br>

# Experimentation
## FLANN

As you can see, i tried this technique and it performance is pretty poor. I also tried to tune the FLANN parameter to make it fit this project but it likely impossible to implement the project this method. So i wonder what kind of technique do the police like Miami Police Department in Dexter using?

# Conclusion
There are a few problem in this project, the fingerprint image have to be the same format like this.
